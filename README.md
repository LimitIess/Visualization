# Visualization

This repository showcases lab work where we explored visualization using R and a variety of libraries such as ggplot2 and plotly.

## Lab 1:

Assignment 1: Modify a decision tree visualization using Inkscape by removing unnecessary elements, renumbering nodes, adjusting colors, and adding explicit percentages below each terminal node.

Assignment 2: Analyze the SENIC dataset in R, including reading the data, identifying outliers, creating density plots, scatter plots, converting plots to Plotly, and developing a Shiny app for interactive visualization.

## Lab 2:

Assignment 1: Analyze olive oil data by creating scatterplots to explore relationships between different acids, regions, and perception problems associated with visualization techniques.

Assignment 2: Perform multidimensional scaling on baseball team data to visualize differences between leagues, identify outliers, and assess the success of the mapping through Shepard plots and scatterplots.

## Lab 3:

Assignment 1: Visualize the distribution of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes using dot maps and choropleth maps. Analyze changes over time, density in countries, and perception problems in the plots.

Assignment 2: Analyze mean incomes of Swedish households using violin plots, surface plots, and choropleth maps. Explore income distributions, dependencies between age groups, and discover new information using geographic visualization.

## Lab 4:

Assignment 1: Visualize economic data using heatmaps, hierarchical clustering, parallel coordinate plots, and radar charts. Analyze clusters, outliers, and the effectiveness of different visualization tools.

Assignment 2: Analyze population census data using scatter plots, density plots, 3D-scatter plots, and trellis plots. Examine income levels, marital status, capital loss, and education levels to draw conclusions and evaluate the use of shingles in visualization.

## Lab 5:

Assignment 1: Visualize the network of individuals involved in the Madrid train bombing using the visNetwork package. Analyze clusters, highlight connected nodes, compute edge betweenness clusters, and create a heatmap of the network.

Assignment 2: Animate time series data on oil and coal consumption using Plotly. Create bubble charts, motion charts, and animated line plots. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of different visualization techniques and analyze clusters using a guided 2D-tour.

## Lab 6:

Assignment 1: Analyze customer feedback on Amazon reviews for a Casio watch. Visualize word clouds, compute TF-IDF values, perform sentiment analysis, create phrase nets, and analyze the findings to understand customer opinions.

Assignment 2: Continue analyzing Italian olive oil data. Create interactive scatter plots, bar charts, and parallel coordinate plots to explore relationships between different acids, regions, and variables. Identify influential variables and suggest strategies for differentiation based on acid levels.
